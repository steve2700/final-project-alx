      Hi, I'm Stewart Nyaruwata, a student at ALX Africa. I created this web app to help children continue learning and having fun with languages. With this app, you can enter a word and get recommendations for similar words. It's a great way to expand your vocabulary!
    </p>
    <p>
      Technologies used in this project include Vue.js for the frontend, Axios for API requests, and Datamuse API for retrieving word recommendations. The app is designed to be engaging and enjoyable for children, with a user-friendly interface and colorful design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore the app and have fun with language learning!
